        There are more people who register to attend MADA dinners as guests than those who
        register to express interest to host a MADA dinner. And even among those who express
        interest in hosting a dinner, many often do not follow through to actually hosting.

      <h4>The Three Phases of Hosting</h4>
      <p>
        Per the project brief and especially after our kickoff meeting with our
        client, my team and I understood that Make America Dinner Again dinner
        hosts go through 3 different phases during their host journey - PRE, INTRA, and
        POST phases.
      </p>

          <h4 class="uppercase text-center grey">Pre</h4>
          <p class="small-font text-center">
            During the Pre-host phase, potential hosts <strong class="text">discover</strong> Make America Dinner
            Again and <strong class="text">search</strong> for ways they can host their own dinner.
          </p>
          <p class="small-font text-center">
            Hosts would ideally either <u class="text">register</u> to host a MADA dinner on our client's
            website, personally <u class="text">reach out</u> to our client by email or social media, or
            just download all the available material on our client’s website and begin
            the <u class="text">host journey on their own</u>.

            the MADA dinner.

          <p class="small-font text-center">

            During this phase hosts decide things like <u class="text">sharing their dinner experience</u> on

            Through our preliminary research, ie: heuristic evaluation, content audit and

            potential barriers users are experiencing to actually getting to host a dinner
            are not in the latter but more sooner.

            Usability testing of our client’s website confirmed our hypothesis.

            Usability testing of our design revealed that users were able to successfully
            begin the host journey and locate the information they needed to follow through.

            For this design sprint, we focused on potential hosts who haven’t started the
            host process as our target user. Our next design process would be to elaborate
            on the guest flow sequence.
