              I worked in healthcare as a registered nurse for 10 years in my hometown, New York,
              and found I thrived most when applying my compassion, creativity, and attention
              to detail to improve situations for the people around me not just under my care
              but also working directly with me.
            </p>
            <p>
              This led me to UX Design - a field where I can dive headfirst into immersing myself
              into finding meaningful solutions to problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              In San Francisco, I pursued my certification in User Experience Design at
              General Assembly, graduated in April 2020, and with every project and every
              learning moment thereafter, I discovered my re-appreciation for research,
              fascinaton with UI/Interaction design, and deep satisfaction from client
              and user feedback.
            </p>
            <p className="margin-top-50">
              When I am not designing, outside of being a wanderlust, Iâ€™m also a proud dog
              mom who enjoys dabbling with digital illustration tools, running, hiking, or
              meditating through mindful street-walking.
            </p>
