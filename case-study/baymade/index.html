      <h2 class="large-top-margin">The Brief</h2>
      <p>
        A local business, Baymade, needs to stay in competition and wants to introduce
        an e-commerce shopping experience to their customers while still maintaining
        their local vibe.

          <p>
            "Careful Critic" shoppers already have a comprehensive checklist of criteria to go
            through to determine the quality of a purchase but the current navigation and
            organization alone leaves them feeling confused and frustrated. They need a less
            exhaustive and satisfying method to finding and getting to trust and purchase
            Baymade's listed merchandise.

          <p>
            By changing the information architecture of the website and providing a consistent
            pattern and hierarchy across the various criteria the "careful critic" requires to
            make a purchase, the target user will be able to analyze products more efficiently
            and effectively and thereby be more likely to get to the checkout flow. This can
            potentially not only increase revenue but also increase foot traffic to the store
            as well.

            Baymade is a retail gift shop and gallery seeking to connect local artists
            to their community. They sell anything from locally made arts to crafts to
            even workshops and classes and also allows their clients to make reservations
            for private events. They are out to "inspire people to make something of their
            own” and "act a a functional permanent local art and crafts fair”.

            Most important thing is QUALITY. They seek out familiar brands and, before making
            a purchase, they need to be able to take their time to shop, read and write reviews,
            analyze descriptions and details such as manufacturing standards and materials, and
            compare multiple items.

      <p class="font-weight-bold">Opening doors of inspiration through empathic design</p>
      <p>
        One approach that worked well on this project was really understanding my target user
        and internalizing what matters to them. In doing so, I was able to understand the
        complex journey my target user must overcome in order to commit to trusting and
        purchasing something which enabled me to design accordingly.

          <p>
            Users, during usability testing, noted being satisfied with the layout of the
            information provided and further, while uncharacteristic of my target user,
            many users during usability testing demonstrated the check-out of an item in
            under 60 seconds from home page to product analysis to checkout confirmation page.

          <p class="font-weight-bold">Card Sort</p>
          <p>
            My design decisions for this sprint were based off of usability findings and
            identified pain-points in the navigation of the existing website. Ideally, a
            card sorting exercise to dictate my new information architecture and site map
            would be my next step to either confirm my design decisions or adjust them to
            what the users would anticipate to find.

          <p>
            Usability testing with users identifying as consistent as possible with my
            target user, the "careful critic" shopper, would yield more accurate results
            of the satisfaction and effectiveness of the prototype.
